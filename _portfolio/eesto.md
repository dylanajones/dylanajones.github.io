title: "Energy Efficient Planning"
excerpt: "We were asking the question of how to plan energy efficient paths throught strong and uncertain disturbances, such as ocean currents and wind fields. I developed the EESTO algorithm and demonstrated the benefits of this algorithm in both simulation and the field using a Platypus Lutra autonomous boat. In the image below you can see the paths the Lutra took on the surface of a lake in the presents of a wind field.<br/><img src='/images/combined_v2.png'>"
