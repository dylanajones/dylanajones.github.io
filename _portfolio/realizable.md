title: "Realizable Path Planning"
excerpt: "We were interested in decreasing the distance between the path that the robot plans and the path that the robot executes. As a first step we developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to find a policy that reduces the distance between the planned and executed path. I am currently working on folding this back into the planning to allow the robot to plan initial paths that are more realizable. Below you can see the results for the policies found by the framework on an automous boat. <br/><img src='/images/field_trials_paths.png'>"
