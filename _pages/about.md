I am a PhD Candidate in my 5th year at Oregon State University studying Robotics. I am a Research Assitant in the [Robotic Decision Making Laboratory](http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/rdml/home) under Geoff Hollinger. I grew up in Portland, OR and went to undergrad at Tufts University in Medford, MA where I recieved a Bachalors of Science in Mechanical Engineering.

Research Interest
======

I am interested in finding solutions that allow robots to be used in the real world. Specifically, I look at problems related to the intersection between path planning and control. I am interested in ways that we can use optimization, modeling, and learning to improve the ability of robots to deal with uncertain and dynamic environments. Please see the projects tab for more detailed information about my research projects.
