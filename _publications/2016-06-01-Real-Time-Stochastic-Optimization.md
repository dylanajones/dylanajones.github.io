We present an iterative optimization algorithm for path planning. The algorithm samples smoothly deformed paths around a current best path and then updates the best path guess based upon a given cost function. We apply this algorithm to the problem of finding an energy-efficient path in an underwater environment. Results are shown for both a simulated current environment and using a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) ocean current data set. These results show that our algorithm is able to plan more feasible energy-efficient paths than current methods.
